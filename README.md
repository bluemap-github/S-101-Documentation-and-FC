# S-101-Documentation-and-FC
Repository issues of S-101 document and feature catalogue

This repository will be used to store documents and create issues for the DCEG Sub-Group under the S-101PT:

- Dataset_Load_Unload Sub-Group: Loading-Strategy
- Scales Sub-Group: Scales and scale minimum policy

*****************
Update 26 November 2021
- Due to the dependency, in terms of final ECDIS display, between the loading strategy and the dataset scales (metadata and scale minimum), the two sub-groups have been merged into the "Scales" Sub-Group.
